        <p>The old website only contained pdoc-generated documentation for the PEPT
        library. It is now automatically (re)generated with every new addition by
        the ReadTheDocs platform (which is awesome!), so that it is always up to
        date. This website should now simply redirect you to the ReadTheDocs-hosted
        documentation.</p>

        <p>If you are not redirected in five seconds,
        <a href="https://pept.readthedocs.io">click here</a>.</p>
