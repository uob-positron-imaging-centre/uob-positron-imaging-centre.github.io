# About the University of Birmingham Positron Imaging Centre
{: .fs-9 }

The Positron Imaging Centre is home to the technique of Positron Emission Particle Tracking or PEPT which is a technique used to track
the positions of particles inside of equipment. For example the position of a milling ball inside a ball mill. Research interests also include advancing simulation both
in the area of granular material such as DEM or MP-PIC and in the area of radiation emission using [GATE](http://www.opengatecollaboration.org/){:target="_blank"}.
