# UoB Positron Imaging Centre Website

This is a website for hosting UoB PIC project documentation, learning resources for new students and anything that you think could be useful to the group!

## Contributing
### Simple

If you don't have experience with GitHub or markdown files then the easiest way to contribute is writing a word, text file, video
etc. to BDJ746@student.bham.ac.uk and I will add the resource to the website.

### Complicated

If you have experience with GitHub and the markdown format you can contribute by simply making a pull request for a new post or page using the markdown format. 
A template for pages can be found in the repository under the name PageTemplate.md.

[This is a good markdown formatting guide]( https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

## TODO:

- [x] Make website
- [ ] Finish about page.
- [ ] Add lots of content
- [ ] Find a way to automatically update site from README.md that are updated in other repositories.
- [ ] Don't let the website become abandoned.
