# The `pept` Library

A Python library that integrates all the tools necessary to perform research using Positron Emission Particle Tracking (PEPT). It includes algorithms for the location, identification and tracking of particles, in addition to tools for visualisation and analysis, and utilities allowing the realistic simulation of PEPT data.


## Positron Emission Particle Tracking
PEPT is a technique developed at the University of Birmingham which allows the non-invasive, three-dimensional tracking of one or more 'tracer' particles through particulate, fluid or multiphase systems. The technique allows particle or fluid motion to be tracked with sub-millimetre accuracy and sub-millisecond temporal resolution and, due to its use of highly-penetrating 511keV gamma rays, can be used to probe the internal dynamics of even large, dense, optically opaque systems - making it ideal for industrial as well as scientific applications.

PEPT is performed by radioactively labelling a particle with a positron-emitting radioisotope such as fluorine-18 (18F) or gallium-66 (66Ga), and using the back-to-back gamma rays produced by electron-positron annihilation events in and around the tracer to triangulate its spatial position. Each detected gamma ray represents a line of response (LoR).

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get started with PEPT data analysis.


### Prerequisites

This package supports Python 3.7 and above - it is built and tested for Python 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 on Windows, Linux and macOS (thanks to [`conda-forge`](https://conda-forge.org/), which is awesome!).

You can install it using the batteries-included [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) or the bare-bones [Python interpreter](https://www.python.org/downloads/). You can also check out our Python and `pept` tutorials [here](https://github.com/uob-positron-imaging-centre/tutorials).


### Installation

The easiest and quickest installation, if you are using Anaconda:

```
conda install -c conda-forge pept
```

You can also install the latest release version of `pept` from PyPI:

```
pip install --upgrade pept
```

Or you can install the development version from the GitHub repository:

```
pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/uob-positron-imaging-centre/pept
```


## Tutorials

Some PEPT analysis example scripts are available on [pept.readthedocs.io](https://pept.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). A minimal script can read PEPT from an online location (e.g. the experiment shown above - two radioactive tracers rotating at 42 RPM), transform the lines of response into accurate tracer locations and plot them in a browser-based interactive 3D graph (live version available [here](https://uob-positron-imaging-centre.github.io/live/sample_42rpm)):

![LoRs analysed using the PEPT-ML minimal script](https://github.com/uob-positron-imaging-centre/misc-hosting/blob/master/pept_centres.png?raw=true)

A more complete PEPT analysis script can track multiple tracers at the same time, produce "tight", separate trajectories and create multiple interactive Plotly subplots that are opened in a webpage (example live graph [here](https://uob-positron-imaging-centre.github.io/live/sample_full_42rpm)). The resulting trajectories can then be post-processed to extract system-specific data - e.g. residence time distributions.

You can download some PEPT data samples from the [UoB Positron Imaging Centre's Repository](https://github.com/uob-positron-imaging-centre/example_data):

```
$> git clone https://github.com/uob-positron-imaging-centre/example_data
```

### Documentation

An absurd amount of time was spent making sure than *every* function and class in the `pept` library is well-documented (and most have examples) and all code is explained through comments - no dragons shall be dwelling in the `pept` source code. The library API / reference can be found [here](https://pept.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pept_api.html) - including a search function for quickly finding what you need.

A very fast-paced introduction to Python is available [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Uq8Ppiv8jR-XSVsKZMcCUNuXW-l6n_RI?usp=sharing); it is aimed at engineers whose background might be a few lines written MATLAB, as well as moderate C/C++ programmers.

A beginner-friendly tutorial for using the `pept` package is available [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1G8XHP9zWMMDVu23PXzANLCOKNP_RjBEO).

The links above point to Google Colaboratory, a Jupyter notebook-hosting website that lets you combine text with Python code, executing it on Google servers. Pretty neat, isn't it?


## Library Architecture

The main purpose of the `pept` library is to provide a common, consistent foundation for PEPT-related algorithms, including tracer tracking, visualisation and post-processing tools - such that they can be used interchangeably, mixed and matched for different systems. Virtually *any* PEPT processing routine follows these steps:

1. Convert raw gamma camera / scanner data into *3D lines* (i.e. the captured gamma rays, or lines of response - LoRs).
2. Take a *sample* of lines, locate tracer locations, then repeat for the next samples.
3. Separate out individual tracer trajectories.
4. Visualise and post-process trajectories.

For these algorithm-agnostic steps, `pept` provides five base data structures upon which the rest of the library is built:

1. [`pept.LineData`](https://pept.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual/generated/pept.LineData.html): general 3D line samples, formatted as *[time, x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2, extra...]*.
2. [`pept.PointData`](https://pept.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual/generated/pept.PointData.html): general 3D point samples, formatted as *[time, x, y, z, extra...]*.
3. [`pept.Pixels`](https://pept.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual/generated/pept.Pixels.html): single 2D pixellised space with physical dimensions, including fast line traversal.
4. [`pept.Voxels`](https://pept.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual/generated/pept.Voxels.html): single 3D voxellised space with physical dimensions, including fast line traversal.

All the data structures above are built on top of NumPy and integrate natively with the rest of the Python / SciPy ecosystem. The rest of the `pept` library is organised into submodules:

- [`pept.scanners`](https://pept.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual/scanners.html): converters between native scanner data and the base classes.
- [`pept.tracking`](https://pept.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual/tracking.html): radioactive tracer tracking algorithms, e.g. the Birmingham method, PEPT-ML, FPI.
- [`pept.plots`](https://pept.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual/plots.html): PEPT data visualisation subroutines.
- [`pept.utilities`](https://pept.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual/utilities.html): general-purpose helpers, e.g. `read_csv`, `traverse3d`.
- [`pept.processing`](https://pept.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual/processing.html): PEPT-oriented post-processing algorithms, e.g. `occupancy2d`.


## Performance

Significant effort has been put into making the algorithms in this package as fast as possible. The most computionally-intensive parts have been implemented in [`C`](https://github.com/uob-positron-imaging-centre/pept/search?l=c) / [`Cython`](https://github.com/uob-positron-imaging-centre/pept/search?l=Cython) and parallelised using `joblib` and `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`. For example, using the `peptml` subpackage, analysing 1,000,000 LoRs on the author's machine (mid 2012 MacBook Pro) takes about 26 s.

The tracking algorithms in `pept.tracking` successfully scaled up to hundreds of processors on BlueBEAR, the University of Birmingham's awesome [supercomputer](https://bear-apps.bham.ac.uk/applications/pept/0.2.2-foss-2019b-Python-3.7.4/).

## Licensing

The `pept` package is [GPL v3.0](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/) licensed. In non-lawyer terms, the key points of this license are:
- You can view, use, copy and modify this code **_freely_**.
- Your modifications must _also_ be licensed with GPL v3.0 or later.
- If you share your modifications with someone, you have to include the source code as well.

Essentially do whatever you want with the code, but don't try selling it saying it's yours :). This is a community-driven project building upon many other wonderful open-source projects (NumPy, Plotly, even Python itself!) without which `pept` simply would not have been possible. GPL v3.0 is indeed a very strong *copyleft* license; it was deliberately chosen to maintain the openness and transparency of great software and progress, and respect the researchers pushing PEPT forward. Frankly, open collaboration is way more efficient than closed, for-profit competition.
